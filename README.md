# My NixOS and Home-Manager configurations

This flake implements my configurations, which have been split from my [monoflake](https://github.com/ninelore/flake) to ensure latter wont be bloated with otherwise unnecessary and partially duplicate inputs.
This flake also heavily relies on the monoflake.
